# MCC-sofaskin 

This is a custom WeeWX skin based on [Sofaskin-CW9009](https://github.com/weatherstorm/Sofaskin-CW9009)

Please note that this is not intended for use on your WeeWX instance, since its heavely personalized to match my needs. You're free to do anything you want with it anyway.

Features:

- Header, Footer and the entire homepage completely rewritten using TailwindCSS
- Live data updates using MQTT
- JS interactive plots on homepage
